# Efficient Algorithms for Complexes of Persistence Modules with Applications

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithms proposed in the paper (link).

The repository is organized as follows:
`compute_pres.py` contains an implentation of the algorithm PresPersMod as described in section 4 of the paper.
`compute_hom_pres.py` contains an implementation of the algorithm PresHom as described in section 3 of the paper.
`main_graph.py` contains an example which has a persistent sheaf over a graph and computes the persistent sheaf cohomology.
`main.py` contains an example for a persistent sheaf over a simplicial complex (Example 24 in the paper).
